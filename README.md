## Project Overview
Budget/Finacial app. The idea behind My2Cents is to steamline the budgeting process as much as possible. The User will select the budget they want to use, either by preset or a custom budget(accounting for: --). Then using Plaid Api to gain access to User bank accounts, the app will sort through recent transactions and propose a budget allowing the User to make changes if necessary. The app will then highlight areas the User is spending an excess of money
> The app will allow the User to skip linking their bank account and manualy enter their information.
